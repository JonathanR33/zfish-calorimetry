# Heat oscillations driven by the embryonic cell cycle arise from the energetic costs of signaling
This repository contains all experimental data and programs for the analysis found in "Heat oscillations driven by the embryonic cell cycle arise from the energetic costs of signaling" by Jonathan Rodenfels, Jonathon Howard and Karla m Neugebauer.

An index for the structure of this repository is given below.

# code
This folder contains the R-scripts and examples files for processing, analyzing, and displaying the data presented in this work.

scripts/ | R-scripts used in this work. R scripts 1-4 used to currate (script 1), normalize (script 2), decompose ( script 3), 
and wavelet transform (script 4) of the measured heat dissipation rate form zebrafish embryos. A single example dataset (one
biological replicate) is provided (example.csv and example.itc). Mathematical cell cycle modeling was computed using script 5.

examples.csv/ | Example isothermal calorimetry data to analyze data presented in this work.

# data
This folder contains all experimental data (.csv) used in the publication.
